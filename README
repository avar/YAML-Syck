NAME
    YAML::Syck - Fast, lightweight YAML loader and dumper

SYNOPSIS
        use YAML::Syck;

        # Set this for interoperability with other YAML/Syck bindings:
        # e.g. Load('Yes') becomes 1 and Load('No') becomes ''.
        $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping = 1;

        $data = Load($yaml);
        $yaml = Dump($data);

        # $file can be an IO object, or a filename
        $data = LoadFile($file);
        DumpFile($file, $data);

        # A string with multiple YAML streams in it
        $yaml = Dump(@data);
        @data = Load($yaml);

        # Dumping into a pre-existing output buffer
        my $yaml;
        DumpInto(\$yaml, @data);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a Perl interface to the libsyck data serialization
    library. It exports the "Dump" and "Load" functions for converting Perl
    data structures to YAML strings, and the other way around.

    NOTE: If you are working with other language's YAML/Syck bindings (such
    as Ruby), please set $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping to 1 before calling the
    "Load"/"Dump" functions. The default setting is for preserving
    backward-compatibility with "YAML.pm".

Differences Between YAML::Syck and YAML
  Error handling
    Some calls are designed to die rather than returning YAML. You should
    wrap your calls in eval to assure you do not get unexpected results.

FLAGS
  $YAML::Syck::Headless
    Defaults to false. Setting this to a true value will make "Dump" omit
    the leading "---\n" marker.

  $YAML::Syck::SortKeys
    Defaults to false. Setting this to a true value will make "Dump" sort
    hash keys.

  $YAML::Syck::SingleQuote
    Defaults to false. Setting this to a true value will make "Dump" always
    emit single quotes instead of bare strings.

  $YAML::Syck::ImplicitTyping
    Defaults to false. Setting this to a true value will make "Load"
    recognize various implicit types in YAML, such as unquoted "true",
    "false", as well as integers and floating-point numbers. Otherwise, only
    "~" is recognized to be "undef".

  $YAML::Syck::ImplicitUnicode
    Defaults to false. For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value
    will make "Load" set Unicode flag on for every string that contains
    valid UTF8 sequences, and make "Dump" return a unicode string.

    Regardless of this flag, Unicode strings are dumped verbatim without
    escaping; byte strings with high-bit set will be dumped with backslash
    escaping.

    However, because YAML does not distinguish between these two kinds of
    strings, so this flag will affect loading of both variants of strings.

    If you want to use LoadFile or DumpFile with unicode, you are required
    to open your own file in order to assure it's UTF8 encoded:

      open(my $fh, ">:encoding(UTF-8)", "out.yml");
      DumpFile($fh, $hashref);

  $YAML::Syck::ImplicitBinary
    Defaults to false. For Perl 5.8.0 or later, setting this to a true value
    will make "Dump" generate Base64-encoded "!!binary" data for all
    non-Unicode scalars containing high-bit bytes.

  $YAML::Syck::UseCode / $YAML::Syck::LoadCode / $YAML::Syck::DumpCode
    These flags control whether or not to try and eval/deparse perl source
    code; each of them defaults to false.

    Setting $YAML::Syck::UseCode to a true value is equivalent to setting
    both $YAML::Syck::LoadCode and $YAML::Syck::DumpCode to true.

  $YAML::Syck::LoadBlessed
    Defaults to true. Setting to false will block YAML::Syck from doing ANY
    blessing. This is an interface change since 1.21. The variable name was
    misleading, implying that no blessing would happen when in fact it did.

    Prior to 1.22, setting this to a false value only prevented "Load" from
    blessing tag names that did not begin with "!!perl" or "!perl";.

BUGS
    Dumping Glob/IO values do not work yet.

    Dumping of Tied variables is unsupported.

    Dumping into tied (or other magic variables) with "DumpInto" might not
    work properly in all cases.

CAVEATS
    This module implements the YAML 1.0 spec. To deal with data in YAML 1.1,
    please use the "YAML::XS" module instead.

    The current implementation bundles libsyck source code; if your system
    has a site-wide shared libsyck, it will *not* be used.

    Tag names such as "!!perl/hash:Foo" is blessed into the package "Foo",
    but the "!hs/foo" and "!!hs/Foo" tags are blessed into "hs::Foo". Note
    that this holds true even if the tag contains non-word characters; for
    example, "!haskell.org/Foo" is blessed into "haskell.org::Foo". Please
    use Class::Rebless to cast it into other user-defined packages. You can
    also set the LoadBlessed flag false to disable all blessing.

    This module has a lot of known issues
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=YAML-Syck> and has
    only been semi-actively maintained since 2007. If you encounter an issue
    with it probably won't be fixed unless you offer up a patch
    <http://github.com/toddr/YAML-Syck> in Git that's ready for release.

    There are still good reasons to use this module, such as better
    interoperability with other syck wrappers (like Ruby's), or some edge
    case of YAML's syntax that it handles better. It'll probably work
    perfectly for you, but if it doesn't you may want to look at YAML::XS,
    or perhaps at looking another serialization format like JSON.
