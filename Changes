[Changes for 0.44 (JSON::Syck 0.12) - 2006-05-04]

* Fix tests so they work warninglessly on 5.005. 

* Fix incorrect indentation level for scalars initialized twice --
  once as string and once as references -- such as the ones produced
  by YAML.pm's Load() function.
  Reported by: Alex Vandiver

* Multilevel self-recursive structures now no longer generate
  redundant anchor names.
  Reported by: Alex Vandiver
